# Burger

## User Story
AS A lover and consumer of burgers, I WANT to list all the burgers I've ever eaten, SO THAT I can keep record of what burgers I've already tried and haven't tried.

## Description
This app connects to a database and gives a user access to add to the database on an HTML page.  Once on the page, the user will be welcomed by a burger image and an input field.  In the input field, the user can add any burger they want.  Once the "Order In" button is pressed, the burger will move to the "Order Up" column.  If the "Devour It!" button is pressed, the burger will move to the "Too Much" column.  The "Too Full" column list the burgers from the database after they've been 'devoured'.  

## Local Deployment
